# NUCLEAR_INCIDENT_PROJECT
Dataset contains details about nuclear incident over  (1957- 2011) 

Nuclear Plant Incidents (1957- 2011) contains the nuclear reactor incidents which occur in nuclear plant due to various reasons such as operational error, electrical error, security guide violation etc.
FEATURES IN THE DATASET REPRESENTS:
-'Date':This column likely contains information about the date when the incident occurred.

-'Incident':The "Incident" column  contains specific details or descriptions of each incident such as the location of 
the incident, a brief summary of what occurred, or any other relevant details.

-'Location': This column probably represents the location where the incident occurred. 

-'Category':This column likely categorizes the incidents into different groups or types based on certain characteristics such as "Safety Systems Failure," "Human Error," "Natural Disaster,"Electrical Error " that help classify the incidents.

-'Numbers of Direct Deaths': This column probably contains the count of direct deaths resulting from each incident.

-'Numbers of InDirect Deaths': This column likely contains the count of indirect deaths resulting from each incident.

-INES\nlevel': This column probably contains information about the INES (International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale) level associated with each incident. 

-'Latitude': This column likely represents the latitude coordinate of the incident location.

-'Longitude': This column likely represents the longitude coordinate of the incident location.

Analysed datasets by 
  1.Temporal:Spikes may indicate specific years with a significantly higher number of incidents, while trends may reveal overall changes over time.Here year 1986 have spikes,that is incidents occured more and other years almost follows same pattern of incidents occured
  2.Geographical:to visualize geographical patterns and identify whether incidents are clustered in specific regions based on their lattitudes and longitudes.
  3.Categorization Analysis:
        * Summarize the incidents by category (Storage/Handling, Operator Error, Technical Flaws, etc.).
        Counts the number of incidents in each category.
        * Determine which categories are more prevalent and if certain categories lead to more severe outcomes.
        Creates a summary table showing the count of incidents for each combination of category and severity.
  4.Casualty Analysis
        Analyze direct and indirect deaths concerning incident categories.
        Identify incidents with the highest casualties and their associated categories.
5. INES Level Analysis:
    Understand the severity of incidents based INES. Are there commonalities among incidents with high INES levels?
    Investigate if higher INES levels correlate with specific categories or regions.
 6. Correlation Analysis:
            Investigate correlations between incident categories, INES levels, geographical locations, and casualty counts.
            Identify any significant patterns or associations between these variables.
